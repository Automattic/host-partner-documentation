# Migrating from version 1.2 to version 1.3

Migrating your existing integration from version 1.2 of the Jetpack Start API to version 1.3 will allow you to take advantage of improved speed, improved UX, and features that are only available in version 1.3.

A number of things have changed between versions 1.2 and 1.3. This document will attempt to cover the high-level changes between versions 1.2 and 1.3, but please be aware that there may be some nuances that are covered in detail outside of this migration document. Please consult the rest of the [Jetpack](./) documentation to get more in-depth description of the functionality in version 1.3.
